<p><b>First Blog (June 10, 2020)</p></b>
<hr>
<p>And Yeah! This is my First blog and I'm Used HTML to Blog and I'm not So Pro to Code with CSS or Java. I will Learned that kind of language if I type in English are now in the correct Grammar. So Basically, This HTML are only one that I can Code.</p>
<p>Im Used Clickteam Fusion 2.5 Engine to Make this Game. Why im Using this Kind of Engine instead of dodot or unity engine?. Because when I am Younger My Friend Watch me a Gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy and I'm tottaly Scared but after a Few Month, I Feel Love of that Game and this Game are one Of my Favorite game. Due to Deep Search About Five Nights at Freddy, I see That It used Clickteam Engine and I was thinking......
What is that Engine! And i Seach it and Clickteam Engine is Using to Make Games or Application. And That's why and have interested to make Game. I'm always Learning how to use that Engine on Watching some tutorials on YouTube, Experimenting of that Engine.</p>
<p>The Current Main Goal of this Game are having a over 50 Mini-Games, 100 Story Scene and a lot of Hidden Mystery. I Know that it take so long but this Current Main Goal, will be changes soon. There Have Three Main Character, John Carlo, Jhemuel and ( They don't have a Name, I'm Still Thinking who are the Third Main CHaracter). The Genre of the Story are Fiction, Fantsy and Horror. </p>
<p> I Know that this Blog are so Short but I'm so happy to Make this Possible, Because nothing is impossible. </p>
