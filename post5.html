<p>The Last Development Blog of this Game '' Student '' will be Discussed about... </p>
<p> > This Game will be Now Free or Name your Price!</p>
<p> > My Plans to Make the Game Successful</p>
<p> > And The Debunk
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>First is.... i want to Answer all the False Information (Debunk) to Clarify before i Published this Game
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Y : PJC2A not Take Criticism, PJC2A said that Before. 
<p>A : Its a Big Yes, i am couldn't take criticism of some Outtopic and Misinformation Issue. I can take Criticism on the true Issue to make myself Better.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Y : PJC2A is Using free Assets and make the Game Paid and not for Free</p>
<p>A : All of my Using Asset is Under Creative Commons License (CC BY-NC 4.0) and it said that '' You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made ''. All of Assets i Used will be credited and the Link in the Main Menu > Credits</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Y : PJC2A is Modified some the Assets and he claims that this is his art!</p>
<p>A : Not Even True, some of i used assets said '' its Free to remix, transform, and build upon the material '' and im not claiming that this is my Artwork.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Y : PJC2A is making this Game for Money Only
<p>A : Both Yes and no. Yes because all the money i Claims will be used for Goods and not on the Bad things. No Because my one of the Main Goal of this Game is to Entertain some the Gamer and this is my Hobbie.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Now, i Answer all the Questions (If you have any Questions, Just Message Facebook.com/GoJohnCarloDev)</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Next is, why this Game are now Free and not Paid.
My One of the Main Goal of this Game is to Entertain some of the Gamer and To Make some money for Goods.</p>
<p>This Game will be Now for free, you Can play it for Free!. And if you Want to Support The Developer in other ways, there has a Three Different ways.</p>
<p>First is to Donate some Money to Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/PJC2A</p>
<p>Second is to Make your own Price ($2.99 is enough to Support me And i will Appreciate it)</p>
<p>Third is by Making some Gameplay Videos.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>I have a Plan's to make some Game will became Successful Enough.</p>
<p>First is I Share my Current Created game and They Advertise it and Helping me to make this Game Better (Thanks to High Leap Studios, Osmium, and Lamina Studios)</p>
<p>Second is to Send Emails some of the YouTubers to Play this Game (It's free to Request) ( Advanced Thanks to Luigikid Gaming, LinX, and the Team Taste Gaming )Â  and i hope that he Accept my Requests.</p>
<p>Third is Before i released this Game. I have Six Main Tester to make sure its 100 % Bug Free and Playable (Thanks Jhemuel Lloyd, Clarenz, Marcloi, John Carlo, Lrac and Lamina Studios) </p>
<p>And the last one is To Share the link all of the Available Groups (it's not Against on Rules and Regulations and it's Able to Post that kind of topic)</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>Remember, this Game are not High Quality. I make this game That Zero Budget and Volunteers are Helping me.
Zero Budget = Small Game. And I hope that You enjoyed my Game. 
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>And That's it for All and Thanks for Following the Development of PJC2A and PJC2A Developer.</p>
